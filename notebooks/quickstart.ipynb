      "1. Good pancakes and they should be after 50 years or so of business!  Used to also be a place to see the occasional celebrity chowing down on some awesome sweet potato pancakes, but I doubt they wait in the line these days.  They're famous for a reason - their pancakes really are good, and they have a nice vibe inside, friendly service, and the prices are fair.  If you don't mind standing in line for a while, come see why they've been around so long.\n",
      "2. First time at Pancake Pantry yesterday (Tuesday)! Got to the restaurant a little after 9am and was seated right away. I was so surprised as I have read the lines can go around the block. After I left around 10:30 was when that happened.   A friend and I shared the banana bread pancakes and the Georgia peach pancakes. Both were very good! The banana bread pancakes are not as sweet if your looking for something more mild to start your day. They have cinnamon inside as well as walnuts. The Georgia peach came will slices of peaches and a peach sauce on top. All in all good service and very good variety of pancake choices\n",
      "3. I love this place- though it is smaller than the Campbell location (or it appears to be). Nonetheless the same great food. If you are a pancake lover, I highly recommend it. The specials are always tasty and the regular menu has a variety of options too.\n",

Go down to the corner of Gulf and 5th to choose from over 100 flavors and see how it's done. That guy has Ice cream stores in other countries. This one takes in about 1500 people a day. Ice cream is sold by weight but these people refused me service. They don't understand business or what a valuable customer is.\n",
      "2. Pretty good ice cream. It has a very soft texture, natural fresh ingredients. No mix-in flavors - the ice cream itself is flavored. Nice people working. They don't make their own cones - they are laser focused on making their ice cream great. The store has a nice courtyard that is dog-friendly.\n",
      "3. We stopped here on a Saturday night for ice cream after dinner. I really liked the atmosphere. The ice cream portion sizes were very large and reasonable prices.   We did not order any food so I can't comment on that.  But base on ice cream and vibe I will come back again and try the food.\n",

      "1. *If you love good quality sushi, you MUST check this place out*  I like to go on a date with my boyfriend to Sagami at least once a month. They have really good quality sushi/sashimi. Overall, their food isn't overly saucy compared to a lot of sushi restaurants. We personally really enjoy that because it makes us feel not too lethargic and bloated at the end of the meal. Their rice is seasoned well and is similar to omakase quality. If you like sashimi/sushi, i highly recommend getting the Chirashi. You get a lot of assorted sashimi with rice at the bottom.  Each sashimi taste so fresh and pairs really nicely with the rice.   Our favorite rolls are the Soft shell crab roll, Hamachi Maki, Unagi Tobiko Maki. But do note that they're on the smaller side.   Our favorite sushi pieces are Salmon, Tuna and Scallop. You must try their Scallop sushi. It's our tradition to always finish our dinner with the Scallop because it's that good!   This place is also BYOB so bring your favorite pair of Sake :)\n",
      "2. ok sushi, cool designs and rolls. My issue is the price here... for 2 people is was $100 and we brought our own wine.  We had 6 rolls, 2 soups, 2 salads. You can go to Yokohomo or Kabuki for half the price. For instance, there eel roll is like $15, but it should be $6-8.  Just a pile of leaves are $7. Nothing else is in the salad. Not much of an atmosphere except the beetles music and pictures. Probably won't go back just based on the prices.\n",
      "3. My friends & like to try new all u can eat sushi places around the area. I really enjoyed their sushi for lunch today. I loved that they had a lunch special for students (with ID) of $14.50. I had the Godzilla roll, the New York, and Sakura. All very good rolls. I also had a \"red wine cooler\" which consisted of cab house wine with a little 7UP. Was a good mix actually! Would recommend this place to my fellow sushi lovers!\n",
