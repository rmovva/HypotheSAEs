    "This notebook demonstrates basic usage of HypotheSAEs on a sample of the Yelp review dataset, entirely using local compute. You will need a GPU*.\n",
    "- We use a sentence-transformers model for text embeddings. This can run on CPU or GPU (if a cuda device is available, it will use GPU).\n",
    "- We use a large language model loaded in vLLM for hypothesis generation and text annotation. This requires GPU.\n",

The food is great, and theres a beer style for everyone, with literally hundreds of haunting flavors throughout that brew menu for you to explore.

Upon entering the restaurant you see the workers there making crepes right in the center of the restaurant and some small tables all around. I love Paris and French things but the decor was even a bit tacky for me (not to mention the overly instrumental \"French\" music and La vie en rose...)   Moving on from that... I came with a few friends to try a few of the savory and sweet crepes. My biggest thing is that I have yet to see a restaurant create a proper savory buckwheat crepe and when I saw it was an option on the menu to have a buckwheat crepe for $1 extra, my heart rejoiced! (Gluten-free friends, you too, can have a gluten-free crepe for $1 extra too) Typically, people here use the same batter for savory and sweet crepes and that's just not right!! I ordered a crepe Breton with chicken, arugula, and almonds and wasn't totally wowed by the experience. The buckwheat crep[... rest of text is truncated]\n",
      "2. Why a place that specializes in crepes only has one crepe cooktop I have no idea. It took 25 minutes to get one. Completely inefficient system. The eggs were very over cooked. The fruit side was frozen melon and blueberries that had no flavor. The staff seemed confused and annoyed to have to be working. On the scramble the cold cheese they put on top was never melted and again the eggs were over cooked and they charged $.75 for each add on which was just like a couple leaves of spinach and a few chopped onions. Ridiculous. The side salad was just a few leaves if mesclun with a raspberry vinaigrette. No options for dressing, that's just what you get. If you're not going to give options then maybe use something a little less specific. And just leaves? I mean add something else. At least some other veggies. I can't see a reason I would ever go back.\n",

I've tried several crepes here my favorite has to be their chicken and berry crepe :) beautiful garden out back that is also dog friendly ! Perfect for relaxing anytime of the day. Often times when I am out on 4th.. its either Cafe Marcel or the Co-op when it comes to deciding where I want to eat!! yes I am comparing this place to the Co-Op because its just that amazing\n",
